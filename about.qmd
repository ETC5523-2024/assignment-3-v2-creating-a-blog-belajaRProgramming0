Hi, my name is Rafli Ramdani, a student of **Master of Business Analytics** at Monash University, Melbourne. The blog is initially created because of my assignment in _Communicating With Data_ and now acting as my data analysis project outputs. Feel free to visit my Github page, connect with me through social media platforms and collaborate in future projects, enjoy!!
